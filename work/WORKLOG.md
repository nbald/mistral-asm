# WORKLOG

Durable project context. This is not a second git log. Do not record routine
commit messages, changed-file lists, or next steps that already live in git or
`work/STATE.md`.

This file is normally append-only, but explicit review commits may compact
redundant entries. Do not treat it as the primary continuation source; use
`work/STATE.md` for current state and read only the recent tail when resuming.

- Initialized autonomous project method and durable continuation files.
- Verification evidence: shell syntax passed for the autonomous loop script.

- Added periodic review policy and final "are you happy?" loop.
- Decision: review notes live under `work/reviews/` when they contain actionable
  findings or an explicit clean result.

- Added operator control channel, external status scripts, and gpt-5.5/xhigh
  defaults for autonomous runs.
- Verification evidence: shell syntax passed for loop/control/status/watch
  scripts; `git diff --check` passed.

- Review finding: `WORKLOG.md` was duplicating git by recording commit messages
  and routine next steps; `STATE.md` held a stale commit pointer.
- Decision: git is authoritative for commits and changed files; `STATE.md` is
  authoritative for next action; `WORKLOG.md` keeps only durable context.
